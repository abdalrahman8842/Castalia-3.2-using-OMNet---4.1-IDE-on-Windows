Castalia-3.2 works fine with OMNet using command-line mode under Linux. 
This package of Castalia has been modified to work with OMNet++ 4.1 IDE under windows and Linux as well. 
You may still need to use command line mode. 
However, this package would be helpful for using OMNet IDE features such as watching variables, using advanced debuggingâ€¦etc 

Known Problem:
Sometimes, you may get the following error:
make[1]: *** [depend] Error 13	Castalia-3.2		line 0	C/C++ Problem

To solve it clean your project then re-built it again
